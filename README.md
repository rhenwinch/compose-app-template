## Troubleshooting

For help with issues which you might encounter when using this template, please refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Gradle Setup üêò

This template is using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the Gradle Version Catalog in the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) file in the `gradle` folder.

## Static Analysis üîç

This template is using [**detekt**](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task). It also uses the **detekt-formatting** plugin which includes the ktlint rules (see https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/formatting/).

## CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/rhenwinch/compose-app-template/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this template, just make sure that you turn on the "Read and Write permissions" on the Action Settings of your repository.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- [Builds APK and Creates a Release](.github/workflows/apk_release_ci.yaml) - Assembled a release APK and creates a GitHub release
